# React Template（⚡️）

⚡️ A minimal React Vite CSR starter template.

> A fork of [template-vite-react](https://github.com/lzm0x219/template-vite-react).

If you are [creating a React app](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app), and need a router,
try [react-router Framework Mode](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/installation) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/file-based-routing).

## Getting Started

```bash
npx degit YieldRay/template-vite-react myapp

cd myapp

git init
```

### Prerequisites

- `npm` and `pnpm` should be installed.
- `git` should be installed (recommended v2.4.11 or higher)

### Available scripts

#### `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

#### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
